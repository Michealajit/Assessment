In today’s challenging world of Blockchain, AI, IoT, and Cloud, we need to be a step ahead of your competitors. Think of the <a href="https://www.aicpa.org/soc.html">AICPA</a>                                        SOC report, also known as the SSAE 18, SOC compliance report as your company’s “Security Best Practices”. You need to demonstrate a level of confidence that your organization can mange your clients’ most confidential
                                        and valuable information, have the procedures and controls in place to provide the required assurance. SOC now stands for &quot;System and Organization Controls`&quot; formerly known as `&quot;Service Organization Controls`&quot;. SSAE
                                        18 (formerly SSAE 16), SOC compliance reports are often used for Vendor Risk Management and for SOX compliance such as SOX 404. SOC 2 Type 2 or SOC 1 Type 2 attest or examination reports are sometime referred to
                                        SOC Certification by clients. SOC 1 Type 2 and SOC 2 Type 2 reports provides the much needed assurance on operative effectiveness of third-party controls. In comparison to <a href="iso-certification-services.html">ISO/IEC 27001 certification</a>                                        audit, the SOC report provides a details of the applicable controls Vs an ISO/IEC 27000 certificate that has no details of controls. The new ISO/IEC 27002:2022 has recently been announced and will define the upcoming ISO/IEC 27001 standard.</p>

        <p>Data Security & Privacy controls are more important in cases where
          data is regulated or sensitive as in case of compliance requirements
          for HIPAA, PCI, CCPA, GDPR, etc. Cloud environments are adding to the
          complexity of the issue. Privacy laws are being enforced that lead to
          heavy fines or penalties. SSAE 18 (formerly SSAE 16), SOC 2 compliance
          audits are now commonly used for Cloud Data Security & Privacy controls
          such as the CSA&apos;s Cloud Control Matrix (latest CCM 4) that also covers
          some GDPR controls. Our SOC 2 Type 2 for <a href="https://accedere.io/cloud-security-assessment.html">cloud
          security</a> compliance or attest reports can also cover the C5 cloud
          standard. A SOC 2 compliance for privacy covers the TSC-Trust Services
          Criteria 2017 Privacy Points of Focus (Control Objectives) or any other
          specific privacy compliance requirements or mandate. The Trust Services
          Privacy Category were formerly known as the Generally Accepted Privacy
          Principles(GAPP) by AICPA. The GAPP was updated to the Privacy Management
          Framework by AICPA in 2020. In comparison the <a href="iso-certification-services.html">ISO/IEC
          27001</a> now has the 27701 or the PIMS.</p>

            <p>Earlier known as SAS 70 reports, then SSAE 16 and now SSAE 18,
              these SOC compliance reports are being used for several years for
              internal controls, security, processing integrity and SOX compliance.
              The SSAE 18 Auditor or SOC Auditor is also known as a &quot;Service Auditor&quot;.
              The SOC 1 compliance report mirrors the ISAE 3402 and SOC 2 compliance
              report mirrors ISAE 3000. The SSAE 18, SOC Auditor can issue a joint
              SOC and ISAE report. SSAE stands for Statement on Standards for
              Attest Engagements. SSAE 18 is the new standard for all SOC reports.
              In fact all SSAE including SSAE 16 got merged in the SSAE 18 standard.
              So we cannot compare SSAE 16 vs SSAE 18. A SOC compliance report
              is technically an &quot;Attest Report&quot;. The &quot;SOC Certification Audit&quot;
              is a  &quot;SSAE 18 SOC Attest Report&quot;, SOC 1 Type 1 or Type 2 or SOC
              2 Type 1or Type 2 for a vendor or third-party or SOX compliance.
              <strong>A Type 2 SOC 2 compliance software</strong> is valid for
              minimum 6 months to a maximum of 12 months. For the misisng period,
              a SOC Bridge Letter for SOC Type 2 may be issued by the Service
              Organization. A SOC report is issued at least every 12 months vs
              an <a href="iso-certification-services.html">ISO/IEC 27001 Certificate</a>
              that is issued for 3 years subject to annual surveillance audit.</p>

            <p> A SOC 1 compliance report is mainly used for ICFR (Internal Controls
              over Financial Reporting) in other words for financial data reporting
              under AT-C 320. A SOC 2 Type 2 compliance is mainly used for nonfinancial
              data reporting. SOC 2 Type 2 compliance uses the TSC as Points of
              Focus under AT-C 205 (formerly under AT 101). The TSP 100, TSC 2017
              is aligned with the COSO Risk Framework and covers 5 criteria namely
              Security (or Common Criteria), Availability, Confidentiality, Processing
              Integrity, and Privacy. <strong>A SOC 2 Type 2 or SOC 1 Type 1 compliance
              software</strong> provides assurance on the controls if operated
              effectively in an environment based on the Description of Controls(System
              Description). A SOC 2 Type 1 or SOC 1 Type 1 compliance report provides
              for controls implemented at a point in time (as on a specific date).
              SOC 1 vs SOC 2 audit is mainly differs on financial or nonfinancial
              data. A SOC Type 1 report refers to a point in time and a Type 2
              report refers to the operating effectiveness over a period of time.
